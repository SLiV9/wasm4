## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, here are just a few ideas:

- **Build a game or experiment, we'll feature it here on wasm4.org!**
- Improve our documentation or write a tutorial.
- Submit a bug report or feature request on Github.
- Answer questions on the forums.
- Implement support for a new tool or language.
- Give the project a star on Github for visibility.

## Roadmap

Here are WASM-4's goals for the future:

- Grow and support a friendly open source community.
- First-class support for new languages: [Swift](https://swiftwasm.org/),
  [Ruby](https://crystal-lang.org), [C#](https://github.com/yowl/csharp-wasm4).
- Port the C runtime to low end handheld devices.
- Support importing and playing music from [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co) and other tools.

## Credits

WASM-4 was started by [Bruno Garcia](https://aduros.com).

It draws much inspiration from other small computers like
[uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html) and [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php),
without which WASM-4 would not exist.
