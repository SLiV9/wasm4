# disk-0 MADNESS

A submission to the [WASM-4 Game Jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/wasm4-v2).

Original page on [itch.io](https://maxcurzi.itch.io/disk-0-madness).

## Objective
__Avoid enemies that have a different color than yours and absorb the ones with the same color as yours.__

Trigger bombs to switch the enemies' color to yours!

Survive as long as possible.
The game gets harder the longer you play, and the music adapts to the difficulty.
You can gain a first extra life at 100.000 points, and more with more points :)

## Controls
### MOUSE:
- __Left Button Hold__ Move the disk (you!). The disk will follow the mouse cursor.
- __Right Button Click__ Switch your color.
- __Middle mouse__: Change palette.

### KEYBOARD:
- __Arrows__: Move the disk (you!).
- __X/Spacebar:__ Switch your color.
- __Z:__ Change palette.

## Multiplayer
### Local

While playing any cart, press Enter to open the WASM-4 menu.
Select "Copy Netplay URL". An invite link (like https://wasm4.org/netplay/#ABCDEF) will be copied to your clipboard for you to send to a friend.
When your friend clicks your link, they'll instantly join your game.
