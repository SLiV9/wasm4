# First Flight

You're a young witch on her first flight. Take to the skies and see how fast you can collect the rings. Can you beat the high score?

This game was made for the [wasm4 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/wasm4-v2) in the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/). The art was created by boo and the gameplay / music was made by tra.

## Game Controls:

* Press X to make a selection.

Race:

* Press Z to slow down.

* Use Up, Down, Left and Right to move.

* Collect Speed Ups (+) to get a quick boost.

We hope you enjoy the game!
